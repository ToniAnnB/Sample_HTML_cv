    <p> I am an aspiring plant pathologist. I aim to contribute to the development of prevention and control measures of plant 
        diesease through extensive research on the mechanisms of plant pathogenesis by various microbes.The overall aim
         is to increase food security and reduce the loss of crops for farmers. Another aim I have is to become a 
         frontend web developer. I have alway been interested in computer programming and so this an area I have been 
         recently exploring.</p>
